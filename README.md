# **Weekday vs Weekend Walking Distance Analysis**

## **Description**

Sabanci University **DSA210 - Introduction to Data Science** Course, Fall **2024-2025** Term Project by **Ege Taş (Student ID: 32378)**.  
This project analyzes my walking distance data, obtained from the Apple Health app, to understand the differences in physical activity levels between weekdays and weekends.

The hypothesis tested in this project is:  
*"My walking distance is higher on weekdays because I spend more time at school and attending classes, whereas on weekends, I typically drive, which reduces my physical activity levels."*

## **Motivation**

The idea for this project originated from my interest in understanding how my daily routines affect my physical activity levels. Walking distance, as a key metric tracked by the Apple Health app, serves as an indicator of my movement throughout the day.

The hypothesis tested in this project is that my walking distance is higher on weekdays due to school-related activities. However, on weekends, my physical activity decreases because I often drive, reducing the need for walking. This analysis provides insights into how my weekly schedule influences my physical activity.

## **Findings**

### **Overall Weekly Trends**
- **Weekdays:** Walking distance is consistently higher on weekdays, likely due to increased movement between classes and buildings on campus.  
- **Weekends:** Walking distances show greater variability, with an overall lower median compared to weekdays. This aligns with my reduced activity levels during weekends when I’m not bound by school routines.

### **Impact of Driving on Activity**
1. **Driving Weekends vs Non-Driving Weekends:**  
   - On weekends when I drive, my walking distance is significantly reduced compared to non-driving weekends.
   - This supports the hypothesis that driving directly impacts physical activity levels.  

2. **Non-Driving Weekends:**  
   - These weekends show walking distances that are still lower than weekdays but higher than driving weekends, reflecting leisure activities that might involve some walking.

## **Limitations**

### **Data-Specific Limitations**
1. **Limited Scope of Data:** The analysis focuses only on walking distances and does not account for other physical activities, such as gym workouts or cycling.  
2. **Simulated Driving Data:** Driving days were manually labeled based on personal routines, which may not fully reflect actual driving habits.

### **Personal Limitations**
1. **Privacy Concerns:** Some metadata from the dataset, such as timestamps and sensitive activity details, were excluded for privacy reasons.  
2. **Knowledge and Resources:** As a student, my experience with advanced data analysis techniques is still growing. While I used effective methods, further improvements could be made with more experience.

## **Future Work**

1. **Hourly Trends:** Analyzing walking data by hour of the day to identify peak activity times on weekdays and weekends.  
2. **Seasonal Analysis:** Extending the dataset to observe differences in walking distances across different seasons (summer vs winter).  
3. **Inclusion of Additional Metrics:** Adding calorie data, step counts, or other metrics from Apple Health for a more comprehensive analysis.  
4. **Lifestyle Correlations:** Exploring correlations between walking distances and other lifestyle factors, such as sleep quality or screen time.
